# Shiny Apps
This is a foler for collection of Shiny Apps that I created.

So far, there are two public Shiny Apps available at http://52.59.160.3:3838

# Wage calculator
This app interactively visualizes wages in CR for a subset of jobs for a year 2016.
The app contains Wage Calculator that calculates expected wage for a position based on provided parameters like:

City, Age, Sex, Length of Expertise in the field and Education

# Flight prices notifications
This app takes user email, daterange, price and destinations as an input from the user and sends (not really) an email notification to the user when all the specified conditions are met.

Dummy and simplified table of flights is used for calculations.

Under the hood, the app creates a table of user inputs if all the fields are filled in and stores the data in the database (not really).
In the last tab, simple user's inputs analytics is provided in visual way.

This app was created for Kiwi Travel Hackathon.
