# Shiny_Apps
This is a foler for collection of Shiny Apps that I created.

So far only one public Shiny App is available at http://52.59.160.3:3838
This app interactively visualizes wages in CR for a subset of jobs for a year 2016.
The app contains Wage Calculator that calculates expected wage for a position based on provided parameters like:
City, Age, Sex, Length of Expertise in the field and Education
